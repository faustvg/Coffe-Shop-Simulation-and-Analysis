# Simulation Study of the Coffee Shop

Software Tools for Simulation and Optimization Final project

Coffee shop  in AnyLogic and Analysis using Software tools like

This repository is the final project from Software Tools Simulation class and contains simulation of a Coffee Shop Processes using AnyLogic.
Tools like  R and Excel were used to code for the analysis of the metrics.

The goal is to propose improvements in the Simulation based on the analysis and observations from the Original model and then implement it and perform an analysis using confidence interval and t_test.
